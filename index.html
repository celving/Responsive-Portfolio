        <p><img id="portrait" src="assets/images/portraitsmall.jpg">I am a MERN full-stack developer-in-training born and raised in the Kansas City metropolitan area. From the day my parents brought home our first computer and introduced me to the dulcet tones of the Windows 95 startup sound, computers have been an essential part of my life. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading suspense and science fiction novels, playing tabletop role-playing games with my friends, singing, and playing video games.

            Though I'm only just getting my feet wet in the tech industry, I relish the opportunity to put my problem-solving skills to work. Nothing satisfies me more than the sense of accomplishment gleaned from seeing a project finally come together after hours of effort.</p>
